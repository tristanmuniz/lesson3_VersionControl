            <p class="lead">Version Control is a system that records changes to a set of files over time.  This is ideal for people who often change or modify files, because in the case that something goes wrong or there is an error you can go back and recall specific versions. The system allows you to change files back to a previous state, change an entire project back to an old state, compare changes to the file over time, see who is modifying the file and much more. Also since it saves all of the work done in the file, it is easy to recover something that has been lost.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Local Version Control has a simple database and keeps all the changes to files under revision control. It was developed a while ago to deal with human errors such as, forgetting which directory you’re in and writing to the wrong file or copying files by accident. Everything in local VCS is in one file that has a Version Database that stores all of the versions of the file. Local VCS was a good fix temporarily for the errors from the original VCS but people began running into problems when they needed to collaborate with developers and the developers could not get into the file.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To deal with people needing to collaborate with developers that were on other systems, Centralized Version Control was created. This system has one server that contains all of the versions of a file and a number of clients can access the files from the Central Server. This also allows everyone to keep track of who is making certain modifications to the file and when. The main issue with this form of version control is if the server were to be down than no one can access the file. Perforce, CVS and Subversion are the Centralized Version Control Systems that are used today.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is different from every other VCS because of the way it stores its data. It stores things in “snapshots”. Every time you save the state of a project, Git saves what all of the files look like at that time and stores a reference to that snapshot. Also, instead of having to go back into each file as it is saved, if a certain file is not modified it will just show a link to the file from the last time is was modified. Compared to the other Version Control Systems, Git changes most aspects of the VCS and almost becomes a mini file system in itself.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has a fairly simple structure. It has three main states that files reside in: committed, modified, and staged. Committed is when your data is stored in the database. Modified is when you have made changes to the file but it is not yet stored in the database. Staged means that you have not made changes to a file but have marked it to go into your next snapshot the way it is. The three main sections of a Git project are the Working Directory, Staging Area and .git directory (Repository). The working directory is where the metadata is stored and where you </p>
